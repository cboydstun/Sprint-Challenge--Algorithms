#### Please add your answers to the **_Analysis of Algorithms_** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n)

The condition in while loop is n^3 but it is being cancelled by n \* n in the body of while loop. Thus, it's time complexity is O(n).

b) O(n^3)

This algorithm has four for loop nested inside of each other. If we ignore small constants in this algorithm, it's time complexity will be O(n^3).

c) O(n)

bunnyEars is a recursive function and it's calling itself once while reducing the n by one with each call. Thus, it's time complexity is O(n).

## Exercise II
